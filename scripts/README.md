# "Personal" script folder

We're receiving quite a lot of different scripts now, so we might as well sort some of them "repo"-style.

# The idea

Keep scripts sorted by creating a folder with your name, put your scripts in it and optionally create a readme explaining what the files are for and crediting as you wish.

## Naming convention

`scripts/your_github_username/*.js`

## What if I haven't created the script?

It's up to you and the script author, feel free to put 3rd party scripts in your own folder or in   
`scripts/vendor/*.js`
