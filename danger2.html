    <h1>DANGER ZONE</h1>
    <p>
        This is a live firing range!
        Access can exclusively bought by bottle caps!

        This entrance is guarded by lots of Portal Turrets!
        Be careful to hear closely and you may be able to hear the Turret Serenade
    </p>

    <button onclick="enterRange()">Enter with bottle caps</button>

    <script>
        function enterRange() {
            let rand = Math.floor((Math.random() * 100) + 1);
            if(rand >= 70) {
                alert("Access Granted - You Rolled " + rand);
            }else {
                alert("Turn Back now! Or you will be shot - You Rolled " + rand);
