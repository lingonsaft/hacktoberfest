    <h1>Barges</h1>
    <p><i>Chorus</i> <br/>Barges, I would like to go with you, <br/>I would like to sail the ocean blue.</p>
    <p>Barges, have you treasures in your hold?, <br/>Do you fight with pirates brave and bold? <br/></p>
    <p>Out of my window, looking in the night, <br/>I can see the barges' flickering light.</p>
    <p>Silently flows the water to the sea, <br/>And the barges too go silently.<br/></p>
    <p><i>Chorus</i><br/></p>
    <p>Out of my window, looking in the night, <br/>I can see the barges' flickering light.</p>
    <p>Starboard shining green and port is flashing red,<br/>I can see their signals far ahead.<br/></p>
    <p><i>Chorus</i><br/></p>
    <p>How my heart wants to sail away with you,<br/>I would like to sail the ocean blue.</p>
    <p>But I must stay beside my window drear<br/>As the barges sail away from here.<br/></p>
    <p><i>Chorus</i><br/></p>
    <h1>The Little Green Frog</h1>
    <p>MMM-AH, went the little green frog one day,<br/>MMM-AH, went the little green frog.</p>
    <p>MMM-AH, went the little green frog one day,<br/>the little green frog went MM-MM-AH.</p>
    <p>WELLLL, we all know frogs go<br/>TRA LA LA LA LA</p>
    <p>TRA LA LA LA LA, <br/>TRA LA LA LA LA<br/></p>
    <p>We all know frogs go<br/>TRA LA LA LA LA</p>
    <p>They don't go MM-MM-AH</p>
