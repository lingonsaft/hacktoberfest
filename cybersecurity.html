<h1>Software Security</h1>
        <h2>What is Software Security?</h2>
        Software security is the idea of engineering software with a robust design so that it is resistant to and continues to function correctly under malicious attack. <br>
        
       <h2>Secure Coding</h2> 
          
         Secure coding is the practice of writing software that’s resistant to attack by malicious or mischievous people or programs. An insecure program can provide access for an attacker to take control of a server or a user’s computer, resulting in anything from denial of service to a single user, to the compromise of secrets, loss of service, or damage to the systems of thousands of users. <br>

<h2>Attacks</h2>
        
        Attacks often take advantage of vulnerabilities found in web-based and other application software. Vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons, including coding mistakes, logic errors, incomplete requirements, and failure to test for unusual or unexpected conditions. Examples of specific errors include: the failure to check the size of user input; failure to filter out unneeded but potentially malicious character sequences from input streams; failure to initialize and clear variables; and poor memory management allowing flaws in one part of the software to affect unrelated and more security critical portions.
<br><br>
There is a flood of public and private information about such vulnerabilities available to attackers and defenders alike, as well as tools and techniques to allow “weaponization” of vulnerabilities into exploits. Attackers can inject specific exploits, including buffer overflows, Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, and click-jacking of code to gain control over vulnerable machines. 
<br>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
Software security best practices leverage good software engineering practice and involve thinking about security early in the software development lifecycle, knowing and understanding common threats, including language-based flaws and pitfalls, designing for security and subjecting all software artifacts to thorough objective risk analyses and testing. <br><br>
Secure coding helps protect a user’s data from theft or corruption. By identifying the insecure coding practices that lead to these errors and educating developers on secure alternatives, we can take proactive steps to help significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in software before deployment.<br><br>

<h2>Next Application Security</h2>
</div>

<div id="lesson3" class="lesson">
<h1>Application Security</h1>
   
   Application security is the use of software, hardware, and procedural methods to protect applications from external threats. 
<br><br>
Security is becoming an increasingly important concern during development as applications become more frequently accessible over networks and are, as a result, vulnerable to a wide variety of threats. <br><br>

<h2>Helpful terms</h2>
<b>Application firewall - </b> an enhanced firewall that limits access by applications to the operating system (OS) of a computer. <br><br>
<b>Backdoor - </b> A method of bypassing established authentication or other security processes to obtain access to a system. <br><br>
<b>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - </b>An attack on an application where malicious executable scripts are injected into a trusted application or website.<br><br>
<b>Countermeasure - </b> is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it.<br><br>
<b>Encryption - </b>The transformation of plaintext data into indecipherable data (ciphertext).<br><br>
<b>IP address - </b>short for Internet Protocol address, is an identifying number for a piece of network hardware.<br><br>
<b>JavaScript hijacking - </b>is a technique that an attacker can use to masquerade as a valid user and read sensitive data from a vulnerable Web application, particularly one using Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScriptand XML). Nearly all major Ajax applications have been found vulnerable.<br><br>
<b>Router - </b> a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. <br><br>
<h2>Countermeasures</h2>
Different techniques are used to surface such security vulnerabilities at different stages of an applications lifecycle such design, development, deployment, upgrade, maintenance.<br><br>
Actions taken to ensure application security are sometimes called countermeasures. The most basic software countermeasure is an application firewall that limits the execution of files or the handling of data by specific installed programs. <br><br>
The most common hardware countermeasure is a router that can prevent the IP address of an individual computer from being directly visible on the Internet. Some basic techniques used for application security are: Input parameter validation, User/Role Authentication & Authorization, Session management, parameter manipulation & exception management, and Auditing and logging. <br><br>
Other countermeasures include conventional firewalls, encryption/decryption programs, anti-virus programs, spywaredetection/removal programs and biometric authentication systems.
<br><br>
   
 
 Security measures built into applications and a sound application security routine minimize the likelihood that unauthorized code will be able to manipulate applications to access, steal, modify, or delete sensitive data. 
<h2>
    Next Information Security
</h2>


</div>
<div id="lesson4" class="lesson">

<h1>Information Security</h1>
   </h4>
Information security ("IS" “InfoSec” "data security") 
is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information.
Its primary concern is for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. (This is often referred to as the “CIA.”)


<br><br>
Ensuring that information is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise. These issues include but are not limited to natural disasters, computer/server malfunction and physical theft.<br><br>  
<h2>Helpful terms</h2>
<b>Authentication - </b>The process that affirms an entity’s credentials, thus proving an identity. <br><br>
<b>CIA - </b> CIA triad (or C/I/A), these three security aspects have long been held as the fundamental principles of Information Security.<br>
<b>Confidentiality: </b>describes the need for information to be accessible only to those that are authorised to view it.
<br>
<b>Integrity:</b> describes the need for information to be protected from modification by those that are not authorised to change it.<br>

<b>Availability: </b> describes the need for information to be available to those that require it, when they require it.<br><br>

<b>Cryptography - </b>or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication. Cryptography involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret.<br><br>

<b> Digital Certificate - </b> An electronic identifier that establishes your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the Web.   <br><br>
<b>Digital Signature - </b> A tool used to provide the authentication of the sender of a message, as well as the origin of the message and identity of the sender. It is unique for every transaction and created with a private key.<br><br>
<b>Hash Functions - </b> These are different from SKC and PKC. They use no key and are also called one-way encryption. Hash functions are mainly used to ensure that a file has remained unchanged.<br><br>
<b>Public Key Cryptography - </b>(PKC): Here two keys are used. This type of encryption is also called asymmetric encryption. One key is the public key that anyone can access. The other key is the private key.<br><br>
    <b>Secret Key Cryptography - </b> (SKC): Here only one key is used for both encryption and decryption. This type of encryption is also referred to as symmetric encryption.<br><br>

<b>User Identification - </b> (User ID, UID) Information (aka credential) that is used to uniquely identify or define attributes about an individual's or entity's identity.<br><br>
Information security handles risk management. Anything that can act as a risk or a threat to the CIA triad must be kept - it cannot be changed, altered or transferred without permission. For example, a message could be modified during transmission by someone intercepting it before it reaches the intended recipient. Good cryptography tools can help mitigate this security threat. Digital signatures can improve information security by enhancing authenticity processes and prompting individuals to prove their identity before they can gain access to computer data.
<h2>
    Next Network Security
</h2>


</div>
<div id="lesson5" class="lesson">
<h1>Network Security</h1>
        
 Network security consists of the policies and practices adopted to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.<br><br> 

Network security includes activities to protect the usability, reliability, integrity and safety of the network. Effective network security targets a variety of threats and stops them from entering or spreading on the network. Network security components include: a) Anti-virus and anti-spyware, b) Firewall, to block unauthorized access to your network, c)Intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks, and d) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), to provide secure remote access.<br><br>
<h2>Helpful terms</h2>
<b>Anti-spyware software- </b>designed to detect and remove unwanted spyware programs. Spyware is a type of malware that is installed on a computer without the user's knowledge in order to collect information.<br><br>
<b>Anti-virus software - </b>utility that detects, prevents, and removes viruses, worms, and other malware from a computer. <br><br>
<b>(IDS)Intrusion Detection System - </b> Software that detects an attack on a network or computer system. <br><br>
<b>(IPS) Intrusion prevention system - </b> a system that monitors a network for malicious activities such as security threats or policy violations.<br><br>
<b>Penetration test - </b>pen test is an authorized simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.<br><br>
<b>(VPN) Virtual private network - </b> is a private network that is built over a public infrastructure.<br><br>
The role of network security is to protect the organization’s IT infrastructure from all types of cyber threats including:<br><br>

Viruses, worms and Trojan horses<br>

Zero-day attacks<br>

Hacker attacks<br>

Denial of service attacks<br>

Spyware and adware
<br><br>

A network malfunction, hacker or virus can cause your entire computer system to shut down and can even permanently destroy all the information on the system.

  Next Disaster Recovery
</h2>

</div>
<div id="lesson6" class="lesson">
 <h1>Disaster recovery</h1>    
   
   Disaster recovery planning is a process that includes performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies in case of a disaster. Any business should have a concrete plan for disaster recovery to resume normal business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster.<br><br>
   <h3>IT disaster recovery control measures can be classified into the following three types:</h3>

Preventive measures – Controls aimed at preventing an event from occurring.<br><br>

Detective measures – Controls aimed at detecting or discovering unwanted events.<br><br>

Corrective measures – Controls aimed at correcting or restoring the system after a disaster or an event.<br>
<br>
Good disaster recovery plan measures dictate that these three types of controls be documented and exercised regularly using so-called "DR tests".<br><br>
<h2>Helpful Terms</h2>
<b>(RTO) recovery time objective - </b>the maximum tolerable length of time that a computer, system, network, or application can be down after a failure or disaster occurs.<br><br>
<b>(RPO) Recovery Point Objective - </b>indicates the maximum ‘age’ of files that an organization must recover from backup storage for normal operations to resume after a disaster.

<h3>A Disater Recovery Plan can include:</h3>
Diagram of the entire IT network and the recovery site.<br><br>

Identifying the most critical IT assets and determining the maximum outage time. Get to know the terms Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO indicates the maximum ‘age’ of files that an organization must recover from backup storage for normal operations to resume after a disaster. <br><br>

</div>
<div id="lesson7" class="lesson">
<h1>End-User Education</h1>
   <h2> “People are the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain.”</h2>
        Mainly due to a lack of awareness, users and employees frequently open the virtual gates to attackers.
        <p>An end user is the human individual that uses any computing-enabled device or appliance. </p>
        The majority of security incidents are the result of human errors and human ignorance and not malicious intent. Therefore, it is critical that significant effort is focused on education and awareness to reduce these occurrences
        <h3>Best practices in this area include:</h3>
        Awareness programs including some basic training combined with ongoing awareness campaigns.<br><br>
        
        Promote an incident reporting culture<br><br>
        Online courses covering the essentials of security awareness <br><br>

<h1>
Next Penetration Test
</h1>

</div>
<div id="lesson10" class="lesson">
 <h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
       A penetration test or pen test, is an authorized simulated attack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. <br><br>
       Pen testers aka ethical hackers essentially get paid to legally break into computers or devices.<br><br>
       Pen tests can be automated with software applications or they can be performed manually.
       <h2>Ethical hacking steps</h2>
     <b>1. Planning and reconnaissance - </b> Get documented permission and gather information.<br><br>
     <b>2. Scanning - </b>inspect code and how the system works.<br><br>
     <b>3. Exploitation - </b>get into the system and back out with information without being noticed.<br><br>
      <b>4. Maintaining access - </b>The goal of this step is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system.<br><br>
      <b>5. Analysis - </b>compile a report detailing:<br>

-Specific vulnerabilities that were exploited<br>

-Sensitive data that was accessed<br>

-The amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected<br><br>

<h2> Penetration Testing Methods</h2>

<b>External Testing - </b>target the assets of a company that are visible on the internet.<br><br>

<b>Internal Testing - </b>test with access to an application behind its firewall.<br><br>

<b>Blind Test - </b>a tester is only given the name of the enterprise that’s being targeted. This gives security personnel a real-time look into how an actual application assault would take place.<br><br>

<b>Double Blind Test - </b>security personnel have no prior knowledge of the simulated attack. <br><br>

<b>Targeted Testing - </b>In this scenario, both the tester and security personnel work together and keep each other appraised of their movements. <br><br>

<p>The main objective of penetration testing is to determine security weaknesses. </p>

<h1>Next Encryption
    
</h1>
</div>
<div id="lesson11" class="lesson">
 <h1>Encryption</h1>
        Encryption is the process of converting data to an unrecognizable or "encrypted" form. <br><br>
        In encryption the information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted.
        
        <h2>Cryptography</h2>

Cryptography or Cryptology is from the Greek words κρυπτός kryptós, "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study" Cryptology is the study of codes, or the art of writing and solving them.
<h2>Cryptanalysis</h2>
Cryptanalysis (from the Greek kryptós, "hidden", and analýein, "to loosen" or "to untie") is the study of analyzing information systemsin order to study the hidden aspects of the systems. Cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages.

<h2>Encryption</h2>


Encryption is the process of converting plain text into something that appears to be random sometimes called ciphertext.

<h2>Decryption</h2>


Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext. A Key is often used to create secret codes.



<h3>Types of Encryption</h3>
<b>Asymmetric-key - </b> or Public Key the encryption key is published or public for anyone to use and encrypt messages. However, only the receiving party has access to the decryption key that is private and enables messages to be read.<br><br>
<b>Symmetric-key - </b>Private or Secret Key the encryption and decryption keys are the same. Communicating parties must have the same key in order to achieve secure communication.<br><br>
Examples of asymmetric systems include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Symmetric models include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
<br><br>
<b> Hashing - </b>or a Hash Function is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key it is always a one-way operation.  <br><br>
<b>(MACs) Message authentication codes - </b>are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value.
