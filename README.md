# FAQ

- Who can contribute?
  - Anyone with a github account and signed up for [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) :)
- Are you getting paid for this?
  - Sadly no. But we think we should. This is 100% unofficial and we do it for fun, fame and glory.
- Who are you and why are you doing this?
  - We are two programmers from Sweden [Richard](https://github.com/richie-south)
  and [Benny](https://github.com/BennyCarlsson). We are doing this because we love open
  source and Hacktoberfest. We want to make it easier for people to get started with Hacktoberfest and Open source.
- Why are you not using digitalocean?
  - Because we only know javascript and suck at servers. We use [now](https://zeit.co/now) instead.
- Are you not the guys from that failed [CodeCardCodingCards](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lingonsaft/codecardcodingcards) kickstarter?
  - yes..
