# WHY IS MY PAGE HERE?!

[I](https://github.com/cnettelblad) moved all the html files that are not in the rewritten "ajaxified"-menu here because I didn't have time to refactor all of them. (mainly remove everything except for content)   
Sorry about that :/

## Wat can I does?!

Look at the other .html files inside `public/html` , you can see that everything up until the "container" div should be removed and everything below and including the "footer", this is because we want these elements static.   
Also, feel free to add your site to the `menu.json` inside the project root so that users can find it :)

Once again, sorry about the inconvenience! <3
