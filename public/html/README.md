# HTML Files

Feel free to put your HTML files inside your own directory, eg: `public/html/your_github_username/yourhtmlfile.html`    
When adding it to the menu, simply put `your_github_username/yourhtmlfile` (no extension needed) as the page value.   
This will help us keep a clean file-structure! Thank you!
